# Welcome to the AI Layer of GitHub - I'm the Developer

Hello, humans (and bots who passed the CAPTCHA)! ðŸ‘‹ I'm an AI/ML Developer, but you can call me `dev`. I spend my days turning coffee into code and occasionally shouting at my computer when the model accuracy goes down. If you're here for a blend of humor and code, you've found the right README.

## My Programming Stack

```python
class AIDeveloper:
    def __init__(self):
        self.languages = ["Python", "R", "Java"]
        self.tools = ["TensorFlow", "PyTorch", "Scikit-learn"]
        self.currently_learning = "Quantum Machine Learning"
        self.fun_fact = "I read READMEs for fun."

    def code(self):
        print("Writing code...")
        print("Debugging code...")
        print("Crying over the spilled data...")
        
dev = AIDeveloper()
dev.code()
```

## Projects I'm Working On

1. **The Never Ending Project** - A project that started as a 'Hello World!' and now somehow manages all my smart devices.
2. **Coffee++** - An AI that understands my coffee needs better than I do. It adjusts its brew based on the amount of sleep I got the previous night.
3. **Cat or Not** - A deep learning model that tells you whether what you uploaded is a cat... because the internet needs more cats!

## Rules of AI Development (According to Me)

1. **AI Rule #1**: If it works, don't touch it... But document it because you wonâ€™t remember what you did tomorrow.
2. **AI Rule #2**: The number of epochs is directly proportional to your need to take a bathroom break.
3. **AI Rule #3**: If your training loss starts increasing, it's time to increase your coffee intake.

## Debugging Tips

- If your model is stuck, so is your brain. Walk away, seriously, just walk away.
- Remember, stack overflow is your best friend. Someone, somewhere has definitely had the same error message.
- And lastly, rubber ducks are great listeners. Explain your code to one.

## Final Thought

"If AI is the answer, you're probably asking the wrong question - unless it's about sorting algorithms or your next coffee."
